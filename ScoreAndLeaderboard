/*
I'm planning to just do something basic like a certain amount of score for getting a slot correct, a row correct, a column correct, or a square correct. 
If a slot is incorrect then take away some score. 
I'm just gonna have a score counter throughout the duration and then write it to a file at the end. 
For the 'leaderboard' type of thing I was just going to use one of the sorting algorithms we went over to display the top 5 from all the scores on the file.
